#### scripts for after effects in order to enhance my workflow

## what i plan to include:
- automatically adds a bouncy reveal text animation to a text layer that changes the scale, position, and rotation of each individual letter
- a panel that creates a shape layer with different options of shapes to start with (circle, rounded square, multiple variations of polystar with 3-6 points), and you can have each shape generate with a stroke, fill, or both; trim paths will also already be added to all of these shapes.
